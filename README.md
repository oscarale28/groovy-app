# üéµ Groovy App

Groovy App is a music application built with Next.js, designed to provide a rich user experience for exploring music, managing personal libraries, and interacting with playlists.

## üß© Features

- **Music Exploration:** Discover new releases, trending albums, and recommended artists.
- **Personal Library Management:** Add and remove favorite tracks and artists from your personal library.
- **Playlist Management:** Create new playlists and add songs to existing playlists.
- **Detailed Views:** View detailed information for albums and artists, including their top tracks and related content.
- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience across various devices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API and Services

- **Spotify API:** Used for fetching comprehensive music data, including albums, artists, and tracks. This powers the music exploration and detailed views.
- **Supabase:** Utilized as the backend service for anonymous user authentication and managing user-specific data such as favorite tracks, artists, and custom playlists.

## üìà Improvement Opportunities

- Implement custom audio player, since the Spotify API no longer provides links to track previews and authentication is required for using Player endpoints, which was not considered within scope.
- Implement global app search.
- Create a dedicated user library page.
- Enhance visual animations.
